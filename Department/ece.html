                            <p class="text-justify">Team Falcon is a group of dedicated and definitely focused students,
                                started out as an
                                initiative to allow interaction between senior and junior students. It was started in
                                the year 2014. Falcon, is a bird of prey that soars high, it was chosen as a name for
                                the group to imply that the students who were a part of falcon would soar above their
                                peers and achieve new heights. The students, at falcon, transfer their knowledge,
                                experiences to the junior students, in the form of workshops and seminars which covers
                                fields like robotics, simulation of analog and digital circuits, PCB designing etc. It's
                                a good platform for learning, for both senior students, who get to teach, and the junior
                                students, who get to learn. It encourages students to try out new ways to explore and
                                discover things by themselves. <br>

                                year UG and PG students.
                                About 250 students participate and showcase their technical and also communication
                                skills. Projects are carried out in various fields of Electronics &Communication
                                Engineering namely Core communication, VLSI, embedded systems, Image processing,
                                robotics, IoT, control etc. Majority of the projects are carried In-house where-as some
                                are carried out in external organizations like ADE, LRDE, ISRO, IISc, BEL etc. Some of
                                the projects can be rolled out as products to help in health care, military and the
                                society in general like robots to monitor the health of senior citizens and the
                                disabled, robots that help the injured in war, pill vending machine, detection of
                                landmines in war zones using Ground Penetration Radar, IoT based water &electricity
                                billing system, storing and tracking of solar power, industrial pollution monitoring
                                system, segregation of waste. Experts from various fields from industry and academia are
                                brought to judge the projects &give expert inputs. Based on the students performance,
                                the judges have continually expressed their happiness regarding the quality of the
                                projects and the enthusiasm of the students in explaining them. They appreciated the
                                students for trying to analyze the need/problems of our day to day life &solve them
                                through reliable and cost effective projects. Many of the students start the work early
                                (3rd and 4th sem) as mini-projects and continue on the same work until their final years
                                and bring out more useful products to the society. This is a great initiative towards
                                realizing our PMs dream of Make-In-India for creating successful young scientists
                                &entrepreneurs directly from the Institution.</p>

                            <p class="text-justify">Mini Project Open House Expo is a celebration of ideas, thoughts and
                                innovation of the
                                1st year, 2nd year and 3rd year students, which is being conducted every semester.
                                Students showcase their projects in the various domains like embedded systems, VLSI,
                                Microcontrollers, Robotics and image processing etc. More than 150 projects are
                                exhibited every semester. These projects are judged by experts from the industry and
                                academics. It promotes out-of-the-box thinking in students and fosters interaction
                                between juniors, seniors and professors. Its a platform where students apply their
                                conceptual knowledge for practical applications. This bridges the gap between what we
                                learn in the classroom and what is needed in the real world.</p>
                            <p class="text-justify">The projects are evaluated under 4 categories like Hardware,
                                Software, Hybrid and Social
                                Impact and best projects are awarded with certificates and cash prize in each category.
                                Hardware projects are those which include electronic circuitry without any software
                                control. Software projects are those which mainly use software tools like LabVIEW,
                                MATLAB and programming in SQL, HTML etc., Hybrid projects are a mixture of hardware and
                                software, i.e., all embedded applications. And Social Impact projects, as the name
                                implies, includes all projects which aim towards the betterment of the society. This
                                event has helped students to perform better during placements and get placed in core
                                companies. It enriches their technical skills and soft skills. Few of the projects are
                                further continued as a final year projects. Project expo has also resulted in publishing
                                of papers in national and international conferences.</p>
